    <p class="holidayDefinition">Jose Protacio Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda, also known as Dr. Jose Rizal, 
        is one of the prominent people who initiated the revolution against the Spanish colonists. He was born 
        in Calamba on June 19, 1861. Rizal was a doctor and a writer. In his 1887 book Noli Me Tangere, he 
        condemned the corrupt Spanish administration over the Philippines. Moreover, several historians concur 
        that the revolution references concepts in that book and El Filibusterismo (Reign of Greed). On 
        December 30, 1996, the centennial of Rizal&apos;s death was commemorated with a reenactment and a 
        flag-raising ceremony. The event involved retracing Rizal&apos;s final steps from his cell at Fort 
        Santiago to the execution site.</p>
