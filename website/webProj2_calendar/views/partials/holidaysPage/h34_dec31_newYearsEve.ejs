    <p class="holidayDefinition">New Year's Eve is the last day of the year and the day before New Year&apos;s Day, 
        which marks the start of a new year according to the Gregorian calendar. Pope Gregory XIII introduced the 
        Gregorian calendar in 1582. It was adopted immediately in some areas of Europe but it was not used in various 
        countries until even centuries later. For example, the United Kingdom and the United States started observing 
        the Gregorian calendar in 1752, in which 11 days were dropped.</p>
