    <p class="holidayDefinition">The celebration of Eid-ul-Adha is to commemorate Prophet Ibrahim&apos;s 
        devotion to Allah SWT and his readiness to sacrifice his son, Ismail. At the very point of sacrifice, 
        Allah SWT replaced Ismail with a ram, which was to be slaughtered in place of his son. This command 
        from Allah SWT was a test of Prophet Ibrahim&apos;s willingness and commitment to obey his Lord&apos;s 
        command, without question. Therefore, Eid-ul-Adha means the festival of sacrifice.</p>
